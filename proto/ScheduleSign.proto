/*
Adds signing keys to a scheduled transaction. If the new keys satisfy the scheduled transaction's signing
requirements, and it was scheduled with <tt>executeImmediatelyOnValidSignatures=true</tt>, it will become 
eligible for execution. In Hedera Services 0.13.0, this will in fact cause its execution immediately
after the triggering <tt>ScheduleSign</tt>; but future releases may change this sequencing.

Upon <tt>SUCCESS</tt>, the receipt includes the <tt>scheduledTransactionID</tt> to use to query for the 
record of the scheduled transaction's execution (if it occurs). 

Other notable response codes include,
<ul>
  <li> <tt>INVALID_SCHEDULE_ID</tt> if there is no schedule with the given <tt>ScheduleID</tt>.
  <li> <tt>SCHEDULE_WAS_DELETD</tt> if the schedule was already deleted.
  <li> <tt>INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID</tt> if the schedule's designated payer account has been deleted.
  <li> <tt>UNRESOLVABLE_REQUIRED_SIGNERS</tt> if the scheduled transaction is no longer valid; for example, if was meant to transfer ℏ to a now-deleted account.
  <li> <tt>SOME_SIGNATURES_WERE_INVALID</tt> if the <tt>ScheduleSign</tt> signature map included invalid signatures. (No keys will be added to the scheduled transaction.)
  <li> <tt>NO_NEW_VALID_SIGNATURES</tt> if the <tt>ScheduleSign</tt> signature map had only valid signatures, but none of them were for keys applicable to the scheduled transaction.
</ul>
